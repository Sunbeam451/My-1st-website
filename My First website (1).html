   <p><i>This marks the day of my graduation</i></p> 
   <br> 
   <p>Honestly, time flies by so fast-
     <br> Feels like it's still 2019, and I'm still a grade 7 student who got excited because there was a 2 week suspension of classes.
       <br> Boy was I mistaken.</p>

   <p>    The COVID-19 global pandemic had the whole world go on lockdown. Bruh I was robbed 3 years of my highschool days, but luckily i got to experience the last year of my JHS face to face.
     <br>Still, i didn't get to experience the roleplays of Florante at Laura and Ibong Adarna, I feel like it would've been fun.
       <br>Well nothing i can do about it, and COVID-19 will most likely be written in history since its a global pandemic that lasted 3 years.
         <br> Yeah 3 years isolated inside of your own home unable to go carelessly out, and having to wear a mask and face shield everytime.
         <br> I'm gonna tell my kids that I survived a 3 year global pandemic, and that they would survive not being able to go out for one day, hehe.
